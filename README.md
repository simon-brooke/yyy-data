# adl-data

A Clojure library designed to import data (mainly geographical and electoral data) into YouYesYet. As such, not directly relevant to anyone but me at this stage, but I will ultimately separate out the more generally useful bits of the import scripts and make them available in a library.

## Usage

At this stage, who knows?
